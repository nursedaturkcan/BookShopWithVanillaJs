# Book Shop With VanillaJs
This project is a web application for a bookshop, created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API. <br/>
On the homepage, there is a navigation bar and a slider.<br/>
The slider displays three different slides, each containing an image.<br/>
At the bottom of the homepage, there is a filtering tool and a book list. The filtering tool is used to filter books by categories.<br/>
The book list consists of cards for each book. Each card displays information such as the book's title, author, rating, description, price, and an "add to basket" button.<br/>
In the top right corner, there is a basket icon. Clicking on this icon opens a basket modal. The basket modal displays the selected books and the total price of the basket. It also includes buttons to remove or add books to the basket.<br/>
JavaScript is used to implement functionalities like adding, removing, and updating the quantity of books in the basket.<br/>
To provide feedback to the user, the application utilizes Toastr, a notification library.<br/>
The books and categories are dynamically loaded from a JSON file.<br/>
The user's basket information is stored using the browser's local storage mechanism. This ensures that the basket content is preserved when the user revisits the page.<br/>
